#UIMachine

**UIMachine** is a javascript/ruby dynamic-state-machine decoupled view manager that supports many traditional forms of navigation and works especially well with animations. It is build with a combination of functional, reactive, and non-function paradigms that work in harmony with one another to preserve the state integrity as per the semantics.  It is both static and dynamic in that it can actively adapt to certain situations, like executing a timer in X seconds from runtime, but provides functional safeguards so violations of semantics is nearly impossible. **We have never had a violation of semantics (UI model integrity) on our production build to date that includes fluid asynchronous animations!**

UIMachine was purpose built for **FittrÂ®**  because we mave multiple platforms to support and a view hierarchy during our workouts that is unrepresentable by apple's storyboard system.  That's not to say that UIMachine is a replacement for typical view management systems, (The majority of our iOS client uses Storyboards), but serves a different purpose.  If you're doing a presentation-like application with lots of animations and the occasional user interaction, this might be the right fit for you.

As our team members are ardent supporters of FreeBSD and rails, this system is designed with many UNIX'isms and Rail's Ways that boil down to increadible simple features like multiplexing UI out to multiple slaves without sacrificing the integrity, snapshotting and versioning allowing UI restoration in a seamless manner, a very nice set ouf auditing tools for debugging, a simple and extensible DSL controller/action paradigm, routing files, and much more!  

We built **UIMachine** with ruby and uses the [OpalRB](http://opalrb.org) implementation; For those unfamiliar, OpalRB is a ruby implementation ontop of javascript.  UIMachine is written in ruby but exports to a generic single **application.js** file that you interface with.  It has been tested with **WebKit DOM-LESS** runtime.

For those worried about performance or the use of an implementation like OpalRB; rest assured, OpalRB maintains specs that are very rigid and well tested.  These specs very closely follow the MRI standards; we have had very few issues with the implementation.  Performance and size are more of an issue here; we are able to run UIMachine on the iPhone with a typical controller dispatch time of around 2ms which is acceptable; our controllers and actions generally emit events and segues in the range of 10-20 seconds minimum so we are well within our specs; The size of OpalRB is of some concern, our package typically exports at around 480kilo-bytes which is more than we would like but given the niceties of ruby, we are inclined you will agree this is worth it.

## Sessions (Persistant and variable storage)
You should never define global or local variables when defining actions and controllers.  You should always use either 

  - `$_["my_var"]` - **Controller lifetime**
  - `$__["my_var"]` - **Global lifetime**

The controller lifetime is destroyed in the case of ``move_segue`` and ``pop_segue`` for the from controller.  During a ``push_segue`` the from controller's `$_` session is saved and restored during a ``pop_segue``

## Special events

####Server Generated Events
 - segue
 - to_action
 - custom
 - snapshot_image - contains 'payload' entry for a snapshot

####Client Generated Events
 - initialize
 - segue_completed
 - tick
 - custom

## Defining a controller and associated actions

Controllers represent one screen in your application.  Typically, this screen may have a few buttons on it, and may have some internal states that it animates between.  Here we are creating a new controller called paperclip.

```ruby
controller "paperclip" do
	on_entry do
		#Declare variables
		$_["n_times_said_something"] = 0     #A variable that will be destroyed when this controller is changed with a move_segue operation
		$__["n_times_shown_paperclip"] += 1  #A variable that is global to the app
		
		#Return information for outgoing segue's toInfo
		{:annoy => true}
  end
end
```

Actions are bound to a specific controller

```ruby
#Notice the connecting # operator.  This means :controller => "paperclip", :action => "default"
action "paperclip#default" do
	on_entry do
		#Declare variables
		# $_["my_variable"] = "test"  #It is not recommended to declar variables here, they have the same scope and lifetime as the controller on_entry and 
		# are not destroyed when this action exits, nor should they be.
		
		#Return additional information to merge with the controller's on_entry
		{:last_opened_document => get_last_opened_document}
	end
	
	#Do something every 1 second, similar to setInterval in javascript
	interval 1 do
		#Send an event to the client with the type "speech"
		send_event "speech", {:say => "It looks like you're trying to save a document"}
		
		#Will save the context
		snapshot
	end
	
	#Do something once after 5 seconds
	timeout 5 do
		#Go to the action "annoying_animations" below, this will not call the on_entry of the annoying_animations.
		to_action "annoying_animations"
	end
	
	#React to a client custom event with a type "exit"
	on :exit do
		#Push a modal on top of this controller, this controller will maintain it's session information in $_ although it will be un-accessible to the pushed controller
		push_segue "confirm_dialog"
	end
	
	on :change_character do
		#Move to a different controller, this will destroy $_ and the client should actually remove the controller
		move_segue "hitler"
	end
end

#Define another action
action "paperclip#annoying_animations" do
	on_entry do
		{:animation => get_next_annoying_animation_name}
	end
	
	on :animation_completed do
		to_action "default"
	end
end
```

## Routes

```ruby
#One-to-One route with the associated name and the destination controller and actions
get "overview" => "overview#current_status"
get "completed_breakdown" => "completed_breakdown#start"
get "paused" => "paused#default"
```

## Multiplexing
The server is designed to either be run on the client, web-server, shared peer, the sky is the limit!  The event system supports multiplexing via master-slave that allows one implementation to control the ``segue_completed`` for intra-controller and intra-action completion.  These synchronization check-points are designed to assist with animations but in a master-slave mode, the slave's are still able to animate fully, but if a slave completes it's animation sequence before the master, it will stall.  If a slave completes after, the slave should not consume the incomming message so in the worst case the slave ends up behind the master but still fully animating with it's own speed.  We generally use slave's under no-animation as many UI platforms we develop on have very few guarantees on synchronization when animations are used.

You will have to queue events that are recieved if you are multiplexing to a slave.  Reset the queue when you recieve a segue event and keep all items in the queue to push to the slave when it attaches.  Otherwise the slave may attach mid-action and not recieve a segue event.  It is recommended that you throttle the slave's event reads with a messaging queue, that way the slave can consume events at an appropriate speed and simulate ''segue_completed''.  You should also drop the ''snapshot_image'' events.

## Segue

There are 3 kinds of segues

 - ``move_segue``
 - ``push_segue``
 - ``pop_segue``

The client is expected to transmit back a ``completed_segue`` after completing the given segue.  Failure to do so will result in an exception.

## Process
The #process call works like an event loop.  The client should call #process with a {:type => "tick"} at the correct time interval and when any custom events have taken place.  #process can return multiple events, such as the snapshot and segue event simultaneously.  This is different than the case of calling process multiple times; multiple events recieved from process are order independent, the client may handle the events in any order the client chooses, even asynchronously.  Multiple calls to process signal ordered events.
